Description: Build a microservice for an online banking system that manages user accounts, transactions, and provides financial reports.
Technologies: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ/Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes.
Features:
User account management.
Transaction processing (deposits, withdrawals, transfers).
Financial reporting and analytics.
Secure communication between microservices.
Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance.

Project Setup
1. Initialize Your Project:
Use Spring Initializr to create a new Spring Boot project.
Add dependencies for Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Cloud, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ/Kafka, and any other necessary libraries.

2. Set Up Your Development Environment:
Ensure you have Docker and Kubernetes installed for containerization and orchestration.
Set up a PostgreSQL database for storing user and transaction data.

Microservices Design
1. User Account Service:
Responsibilities: Manage user registration, authentication, and account details.
Endpoints:
POST /users/register: Register a new user.
POST /users/login: Authenticate a user.
GET /users/{id}: Retrieve user details.
2. Transaction Service:
Responsibilities: Handle deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
Endpoints:
POST /transactions/deposit: Deposit money into an account.
POST /transactions/withdraw: Withdraw money from an account.
POST /transactions/transfer: Transfer money between accounts.
GET /transactions/{id}: Retrieve transaction details.

3. Reporting Service:
Responsibilities: Generate financial reports and analytics.
Endpoints:
GET /reports/summary: Get a summary of financial activities.
GET /reports/{id}: Retrieve detailed reports for a specific user or account.

Communication and Integration
1. Inter-Service Communication:
Use RabbitMQ or Kafka for messaging between microservices.
Implement REST APIs for synchronous communication.
2. Security:
Use Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure communication.
3. Fault Tolerance:
Implement the Circuit Breaker pattern using Spring Cloud Netflix Hystrix.
Use retries and fallbacks to handle failures gracefully

Deployment
1. Containerization:
Create Dockerfiles for each microservice.
Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.
2. Orchestration:
Deploy your microservices to a Kubernetes cluster.
Use Helm charts for managing Kubernetes deployments.


Additional Features
1. Monitoring and Logging:
Integrate tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
Use ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.
2. API Gateway:
Implement an API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway to route requests to appropriate microservices.

Documentation
1. API Documentation:
Use Swagger/OpenAPI for documenting your APIs.
Ensure your endpoints are well-documented and easy to understand.
2. Project Documentation:
Create a README file with instructions on how to set up and run your project.
Include diagrams and explanations of your microservices architecture.
